        <p>
            So they lov'd, as love in twain <br>
            Had the essence but in one; <br>
            Two distincts, division none  <br>
            Number there in love was slain.
            <br> <br>
            
            Hearts remote, yet not asunder; <br>
            Distance, and no space was seen <br>
            'Twixt the turtle and his queen; <br>
            But in them it were a wonder.
            <br> 
             <br>
            
            So between them love did shine, <br>
            That the turtle saw his right <br>
            Flaming in the phoenix' sight: <br>
            Either was the other's mine.
